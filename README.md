## Manuel Hugo Theme

Like many others at the end of 2020 I was going through a moment of self-introspection.
Googling around 'minimalism' I stumbled upon [Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/)
and I thought it was beautiful.

I also have a personal page. I didn't update it in years, but it was a blog once.
Manuel's website made me want to write again. I wanted something personal, so I looked
for Hugo themes that were simple enough.

I found [simpleness](https://themes.gohugo.io/simpleness/). I wanted to make it mine. I
removed many things. Is not perfect, but here it is.
